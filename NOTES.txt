Game state source of truth is on Server, it's like this to prevent cheating

However this may need to lag on client side.

Hence came along client side prediction.

Since state is deterministic, moves/attacks can be predictively shown on Client before they are confirmed true on Server*. 
    The Client will be unable to cheat because their position will be adjusted by server in a state update.

One more issue can show up is where the client sends two moves/attacks, the server receives the first move/attack, and confirms it AFTER the client has predictively made the 2nd move/attack, leading the client to lag back
This can be solved by adding a counter to moves/attacks.



*Don't show player deaths, player deaths should always be determined by the server

IMPORTANT Server should update at 30 Hz recommended  

IMPORTANTPacket max size is 512Bytes to avoid packet loss.  Try to packets lower than 512Bytes
